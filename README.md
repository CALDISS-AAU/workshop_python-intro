# workshop_python-intro

This repo serves two functions:
1. It acts as a repository for teaching material used in introductory Python workshop at CALDISS
2. It acts as a repository for the content of the e-course "Introduktion til Python for Samfundsvidenskab"

### `parse_ws-md.py`

This file is an attempt at simplifying converting a Jupyter notebook to a series of content folders that can be immediately converted to a Hugo site [https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/).

The file is in active development. Manual corrections of the created markdown files from the file are still required.
